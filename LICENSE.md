**Version 1.0**

## 1. Purpose

This license grants limited rights to use the Software solely for the purposes of education, review, and execution in its original, unmodified form.

2.2. Distribution of the License (`LICENSE.md`) must be accompanied by a file named `LICENSE.md.asc`, which contains a GPG signature of the content or hash of `LICENSE.md`. This signature is used to prove authorship and confirm the legal applicability of this License.

2.3. The use of a GPG signature does not limit the author’s ability to assert exclusive rights by other legally accepted means, including in the event of lost or compromised keys.
